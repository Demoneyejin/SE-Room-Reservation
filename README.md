# SE-Room-Reservation
This repo rerepsents a group project created for software engineering at FIU fall semester. The idea of the project is to create a web based app that allows you to reserve any room at FIU to use for studying or meetings and upload that data as wanted by the meeting group.

It uses a stack of Angular for the front-end  
Java Spring for the Backend  
and MongoDB for storage
